Portfolio Project for my CS261 - Data Structures class at Oregon State University.

The purpose of this assignment was to implement a HashMap in two forms - using Separate Chaining, and again via Open Addressing with Quadratic Probing. 
Skeleton code was provided for all files.

The following methods were implememented and tested.
Methods implemented for Separate Chaining and for Open Addressing:

put() 
empty_buckets()
table_load()
clear() 
resize_table() 
get() 
contains_key() 
remove() 
get_keys_and_values()

This method was implemented for Separate Chaining only:

find_mode()

These methods were implemented for Open Addressing only:

__iter__(), __next__() [iterator implementation]
